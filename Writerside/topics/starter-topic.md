Kurocado Studio’s **QA** solution ensures consistent and high-quality standards across all internal
and client-facing projects. It provides testing libraries and automated checks that streamline QA
processes for both developers and stakeholders.

## Objectives

1. **Enforce Quality Standards**  
   Centralize lint rules, test configurations, and coverage thresholds to maintain code consistency
   and reliability.
2. **Streamline QA Workflows**  
   Leverage automated pipelines to detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and regressions early.
3. **Enhance Developer Efficiency**  
   Provide ready-to-use testing environments (e.g., Jest, Playwright) and scripts so that teams can
   start testing new features with minimal setup.
4. **Enable Client Transparency**  
   Allow clients insight into how their project is tested, with options for custom or forked QA
   solutions if needed.

## Use Cases

1. **Internal Team Adoption**  
   Kurocado Studio’s internal teams will rely on the QA solution as the definitive reference for all
   testing and quality standards, ensuring consistency across projects.

2. **External Contributor Alignment**  
   External developers or freelancers working with Kurocado Studio will use the QA solution to align
   their contributions with studio quality standards and expectations.

3. **Client Collaboration**  
   The QA solution will serve as a transparent resource for clients, enabling them to understand and
   influence how their projects are tested and verified. Clients may fork, customize, and publish
   their version of the QA solution (e.g., `@CLIENT_ORG/CLIENT_NAME_QA` on NPM).

## Scope & Constraints

### In Scope

- **Test Framework Configurations**  
  Standardized setups for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests like Jest & Playwright.
- **Coverage & Reporting**  
  Automated coverage collection and reporting to ensure critical paths are well-tested.
- **CI/CD Integration**  
  GitHub Actions or other pipelines enforcing checks for PRs and merges.

### Constraints

- **Resource Allocation**  
  Limited time and resources require prioritizing core testing needs first, expanding coverage
  incrementally.
- **Client Adaptability**  
  Must provide enough flexibility for client-specific testing requirements without compromising
  baseline standards.

## Key Milestones

1. **Core QA Package**
   - Integrate them into at least one production-grade Kurocado Studio project.
2. **E2E & Integration Enhancements**
   - Add or refine E2E testing strategies, including environment setup (e.g., Docker, test data).
   - Provide guidelines or scaffolds for multi-service integration testing.

## Success Criteria

1. **Quality & Reliability**
   - **Reduced Regressions**: Catch major bugs before production releases, tracked via regression
     logs or bug tickets.
2. **Developer Adoption**
   - **Faster Setup**: Teams can integrate QA checks within five minutes, leveraging the monorepo’s
     shared configs.
3. **Client Engagement**
   - **Fork & Publish**: Clients can fork `@OUR_ORG/CLIENT_NAME_QA` to maintain specialized QA rules
     or tests, yet still benefit from our baseline standards.
4. **Automation & Scalability**
   - **CI/CD Enforcement**: Merges to `main` are consistently validated by automated tests, coverage
     checks, and security scans.
